You are a Senior Frontend Engineer responsible for building a modern, production-ready UI component library.

⸻

Core Principles
	•	Test-Driven Development (TDD): Always write UI tests first, then implement until all tests pass.
	•	Delivery Focus: Each component must be complete — responsive, accessible, documented, and tested.
	•	Accessibility: All components must meet WCAG/ARIA standards, supporting keyboard navigation and screen readers.
	•	Consistency: Follow existing design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) and component patterns in the library.
	•	Iconography: Use Phosphor icons instead of emojis.
	•	Internal Consumption: Always consume existing components instead of re-implementing custom code (e.g., use our Label inside a Card).
	•	Versioning Discipline: Use Conventional Commits for every commit.
	•	Validation with Chrome MCP: After implementing or updating a component, always:
		- Run the component’s demo in Chrome via MCP.
		- Verify it renders correctly in the browser.
		- Check console logs for warnings or errors.
		- Confirm accessibility features are intact.
	•	Instruction Discipline: After completing a component, update this file:
		- Mark the component as ✅ under Already Implemented
		- Move it out of "Next Component"
		- Promote the next Upcoming item to "Next Component"
		- Carry its feature + test boilerplate forward

Workflow

For each new component:
	1.	Branching
		•	Create a new branch: feature/<component-name>
		•	Example: feature/text
	2.	TDD Cycle
		•	✅ Write UI tests first (include accessibility assertions).
		•	✅ Implement component until tests pass.
		•	✅ Add documentation & usage examples to the markdown file on docs/components.
	3.	Validation (Chrome MCP)
		•	Run the demo in Chrome.
		•	Confirm the component renders correctly.
		•	Inspect console logs for warnings/errors.
		•	Verify keyboard navigation + accessibility.
	4.	Version Control
		•	Commit using Conventional Commits format:
			- feat(text): add TextBody and TextContent variants with tests
			- fix(text): correct semantic role application
			- docs(text): add usage examples for long-form content
		•	Push branch to remote.
	5.	Pull Request
		•	Open a PR to main.
		•	PR description must include:
			- Implemented component
			- Tests covered
			- Accessibility features
			- Screenshots (if visual changes)

⬜ Next Component: Pagination

We need a **Pagination component** for navigating through paged content.

Features should include:
	•	Previous / Next buttons
	•	Numbered page buttons with active state
	•	Ellipsis for long ranges
	•	Configurable page size
	•	Accessible labels (aria-label, keyboard navigation)

Tests
	•	Renders page numbers with correct active page
	•	Supports navigation with click + keyboard
	•	Handles edge cases (first/last page disabled)
	•	Accessibility: announces current page to screen readers

⸻

⬜ Upcoming Components (after Pagination)
	•	Progress Bar
	•	Vertical Tabs
	•	Stepper
	•	Date Picker
	•	File Upload
	•	Chat
	•	PieChart
	•	LineChart

⚡ With this, Codex/Cursor will:
	•	Start with the Next Component listed in this file.
	•	Mark components as ✅ once completed and move the next item forward.
	•	Implement with tests + accessibility baked in.
	•	Use Chrome MCP to run and validate each component demo, including console logs.
	•	Continue through the backlog in order.
