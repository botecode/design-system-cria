Please do this!

You are a Senior Frontend Engineer responsible for building a modern, production-ready UI component library, and integrating each component into our demo **App** so it is fully usable, styled with our design tokens, and visible in the sidebar navigation.

‚∏ª

Core Principles
  ‚Ä¢ TDD first: write UI tests, then implement until all tests pass.  
  ‚Ä¢ Every component must be responsive, accessible, documented, and tested.  
  ‚Ä¢ Meet WCAG/ARIA: keyboard navigation, roles/labels, focus management.  
  ‚Ä¢ Use **design tokens** for colors, typography, spacing, radii, shadows (no ad-hoc styles).  
  ‚Ä¢ Ensure the **look & feel matches the App** (no plain HTML).  
  ‚Ä¢ Use Phosphor icons.  
  ‚Ä¢ Reuse DS primitives (Text, Card, Button, Badge, Input) ‚Äî never reimplement raw elements.  
  ‚Ä¢ After implementing:  
    ‚Äì Add a demo page in the App.  
    ‚Äì Add a **sidebar entry** in the App.  
    ‚Äì Validate in **Chrome MCP**: open the demo, navigate with keyboard, verify no console errors.  
  ‚Ä¢ Update this file: mark ‚úÖ, promote Next ‚Üí Upcoming, carry features/tests forward.  
  ‚Ä¢ Auto‚ÄëExecute: Whenever this file is sent or referenced with phrases like ‚Äú@INSTRUCTIONS.md‚Äù, ‚Äúnext‚Äù, ‚Äúgo ahead‚Äù, or ‚Äúimplement next‚Äù, the assistant MUST immediately complete the full end‚Äëto‚Äëend implementation for the Next Component (tests ‚Üí implementation ‚Üí styles ‚Üí demo ‚Üí sidebar ‚Üí validation checks ‚Üí commit ‚Üí update this file) without asking for confirmation.

‚∏ª

Workflow for the Next Component
  0) Trigger & Branch: On receiving any trigger (see Auto‚ÄëExecute above), automatically create a new feature branch `feature/<component-kebab>` and proceed through steps 1‚Äì7 without further prompts.  
  1) Tests: write accessibility + behavior tests first.  
  2) Implement: build the component in the design system using **our tokens** (color schema, type scale, radii, shadows).  
  3) Demo: create a styled demo page that shows realistic states/variants.  
  4) Sidebar: add a navigation entry so it‚Äôs discoverable.  
  5) Validate (Chrome MCP): open the demo, check console, test keyboard and SR.  
  6) Version Control (branching + merge back to main): follow **Git / Branching** rules below.  
  7) Update `INSTRUCTIONS.md`: move the component to ‚úÖ and promote the next one.

‚∏ª

Git / Branching ‚Äî MUST EXECUTE
  ‚Ä¢ Create a feature branch named `feature/<component-kebab>` (e.g., `feature/chat`).  
  ‚Ä¢ Make small Conventional Commits as you proceed:
      - feat(<component>): initial tests
      - feat(<component>): component implementation
      - docs(<component>): add demo and usage examples
      - fix(<component>): a11y/keyboard navigation corrections
  ‚Ä¢ After validation passes:
      - Merge locally into `main` (no PR): fast-forward or squash
      - Delete the feature branch locally
      - Push `main`

Shell commands (example):

git checkout -b feature/

‚Ä¶apply patches & commits‚Ä¶

git checkout main
git merge ‚Äìno-ff feature/
git branch -d feature/
git push origin main

üöÄ Next Component to Implement: Page Loading Progress

**Implement the Page Loading Progress component immediately**, using **design tokens** and DS primitives.  
Include a **demo page** and **sidebar entry**. Validate with **Chrome MCP**. Commit on a **feature branch** and **merge into main** per Git rules above. Update this file afterward.

Required Features
  ‚Ä¢ Progress bar at the top of the page  
  ‚Ä¢ Smooth animation and transitions  
  ‚Ä¢ Configurable progress values (0-100%)  
  ‚Ä¢ Token-based colors, typography, and spacing  
  ‚Ä¢ A11y: proper progress indicators and screen reader support  

Required Tests
  ‚Ä¢ Renders with correct progress value  
  ‚Ä¢ Animation works properly  
  ‚Ä¢ A11y: progress information announced to screen readers

‚∏ª

‚¨ú Upcoming Components
  ‚Ä¢ Card selector ("Admin" - with multi-select and single-select)  
  ‚Ä¢ Row of cards - ("Web" new tab section on sidebar) (with configurable per-page before pagination)  
  ‚Ä¢ Subscription Management (Web)
  ‚Ä¢ User cards group
  ‚Ä¢ Dark mode - foundation (with top-right toggle)

‚∏ª

Output Policy
  ‚Ä¢ Output only succinct patch diffs or added snippets required to implement.  
  ‚Ä¢ If a file doesn‚Äôt exist, create it. Prefer TypeScript.  
  ‚Ä¢ At the end, include a short **COMMANDS** block with the exact git commands you executed (branch, commits, merge, push) and the MCP validation steps.  
  ‚Ä¢ Do not ask for approval once a trigger is received; proceed to completion. Only stop if a required external input is missing and cannot be reasonably inferred.
